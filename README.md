private keys found on AVM Fritz!Box firmware images

# background

After the "House of Keys" [1] research by the company SEC Consult I
looked for private keys on firmware images from Fritz!Box products
of the company AVM.

The result is not that spectacular, but I wanted to share it:
Four private key files, but all password protected. Only for one
of them I was able to find the password ("fritzbox").
